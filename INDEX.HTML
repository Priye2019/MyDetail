Hajipur is the 10th leading city and 17th most populous city of Bihar, making it the second-fastest developing city,
next to Patna. It had a total population of 1.47 lakh as per census 2011. Vaishali district[12] is ranked 8th on a
list of 38 districts in Bihar in terms of growth.[13]

The city is known for cultivating bananas.[14] Patna, the capital of Bihar is only 10 km (6.2 mi) from Hajipur.
The metropolis of Patna comprises PRDA area,[15] includes Hajipur.[16] Mahatma Gandhi Setu, one of the longest bridges
in the world at 5.75 kilometres (3.57 mi),[17][18] links it to Patna. After Patna, it is the fastest-developing city in Bihar,
primarily because of its close proximity to Patna (just 10 km). The Ganges river separates the city of Patna and Hajipur.
On the South bank of the Ganges is the city of Patna and to the North bank of the river is the city of Hajipur,
& the Gandhi Setu bridge ~connects both of the cities. There have been another bridge known as Digha Pool which connects
the river gandak and Ganga and narrows the distance between hajipur and Patna There have been plans to expand Patna to
Greater Patna, by absorbing Hajipur and other surrounding towns into it.[19]
